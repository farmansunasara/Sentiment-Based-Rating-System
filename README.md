This project aims to predict product ratings using natural language processing techniques on customer reviews. Leveraging sentiment analysis, the system automatically assigns a rating score to each product based on the sentiment expressed in its reviews. The process involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training to achieve accurate rating predictions. This repository contains the code and resources necessary to replicate the sentiment analysis model and apply it to new datasets. Whether you're interested in understanding customer sentiment or improving product ratings, this project provides a robust framework for analyzing textual reviews and deriving actionable insights.
